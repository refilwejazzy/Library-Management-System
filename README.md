**Overview**
The Library Management System (LMS) is a user-friendly application designed to facilitate the management of books and members within a library. While the system does not allow users to add new books or search for specific titles, it provides essential functionalities such as browsing books, borrowing, returning, viewing borrowed books, and logging out.

- **View Borrowed Books**: See a list of books currently borrowed by the user.
- **Member Management**: Register new members with their name and email.

**Implementation Details**
- **User Interface**: The system utilizes a simple text-based menu interface for easy navigation.
- **Exception Handling**: Utilizes exceptions to handle errors gracefully, ensuring smooth operation and preventing program crashes.
- **Assertions and Input Validation**: Validates user inputs and ensures the integrity of the system.
- **Collections and Generics**: Utilizes collections to manage books and members, ensuring type safety.

**How to Use**
**Installation:**
1. Download the source code from the GitHub repository.
2. Compile the code using a Java compiler.
3. Run the main Java file (LibraryManagementSystem.java).

**Usage:**
1. Follow the on-screen instructions to browse books, borrow or return books, view borrowed books, and logout when done.

**Error Handling**
The Library Management System is equipped with robust error handling mechanisms:
- **Exception Handling**: Utilizes try-catch blocks to handle exceptions gracefully, providing informative error messages to the user in case of errors.
- **Input Validation**: Validates user inputs to prevent invalid data entry, ensuring the smooth operation of the system.
- **Assertions**: Employs assertions to validate the state of the program, ensuring that critical conditions are met during execution.

**Conclusion**
The Library Management System provides a convenient solution for managing books and members in a library setting. While it offers essential functionalities, it may require additional features like book addition and search capabilities for broader use cases.

**Deployment**
To deploy the Library Management System:
1. Clone or download the source code from the GitHub repository.
2. Compile the code using a Java compiler.
3. Run the main Java file (LibraryManagementSystem.java) to start the program.
